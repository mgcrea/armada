// Generate the app's What's New pane from `CHANGELOG.md`.
//
// The release notes users read inside the app have to be the release notes the
// repository wrote, and the only way to guarantee that is to have one of them
// come out of the other with a `--check` gate behind it.
//
// The parse is shared with `changelog-notes.mjs`, which renders one section as
// HTML for the Sparkle appcast. One file, one parser — see the header of
// `lib/changelog.mjs` for why that matters more than it looks. Both are
// cupertino's, copied rather than shared because the two repos have no package
// in common.
//
// ## What is dropped, and where
//
// Two things, both here rather than in SwiftUI, so that the bytes never reach
// the binary and the decision is visible where the data is discarded:
//
//   - `HIDDEN_SECTIONS` (`### Internal`). Repo-facing prose about CI and
//     generators; a user asking what changed in the app gets nothing from it.
//     The set lives in `lib/changelog.mjs`, because the appcast and the GitHub
//     release body have to leave out the same sections, and it once lived here
//     alone while both of them showed it.
//   - Everything past the most recent `SHOWN` releases. This is the pane you
//     open after updating, not an archive.
//
// `## [Unreleased]` is kept, but emitted separately as `Changelog.unreleased`
// and shown only in debug builds. A generator that silently discarded it would
// be one whose --check could not tell you what went missing, and it genuinely
// describes what a `make run` build contains.
//
// ## Before the first release
//
// DIVERGES from cupertino, which exits when no released section exists. Armada
// generated this file for the first time with nothing but `## [Unreleased]` in
// the changelog, and that is a true state rather than a typo. A mistyped
// heading is still caught: `## [1.0] - …` parses as a release, not as
// `[Unreleased]`, and fails the heading check below. What is refused is a file
// with no `## ` section at all.
//
//   node scripts/generate-changelog.mjs            # write
//   node scripts/generate-changelog.mjs --check    # verify, write nothing
