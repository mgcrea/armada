/**
 * The failures these guard against are silent in both directions.
 *
 * Two consumers read this parse — the Sparkle appcast every user sees when they
 * update, and the generated What's New pane inside the app — and a shape neither
 * anticipated does not crash: it drops a bullet from one of them while the other
 * keeps rendering. Nobody notices for a release or two.
 *
 * The fixture is not a tidy example. It is the awkward shapes the real
 * CHANGELOG.md actually contains:
 *
 *   - a `###` group whose prose sits between the heading and the first bullet
 *   - a bullet with NO bold headline at all
 *   - a bold headline with a code span inside it
 *   - a bullet with a second paragraph after a blank line
 *   - a bare number, which the placeholder restoration once ate as an index
 *   - a `## [Unreleased]` heading, which carries no date
 *   - a `### Internal` group, which no renderer may show a user

const FIXTURE = `# Changelog

Intro prose that belongs to no release.

<!-- <generated:version> generated from package.json by \`make version\` -->

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Something.** In flight.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

Not every fix here is a bullet; this line is the group's own lead.

- **A surface that shells out to \`node\` could not find it.** From March 2026
  onward the gateway answers 400 and keeps serving.

  A second paragraph, after a blank line.

- **Plain.** One line only.

### Note for 1.0.0 users

- No headline on this one at all.

### Internal

- **CI.** Repo-facing prose that no user should be shown.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **First.** It shipped.
