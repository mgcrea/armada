// CHANGELOG.md, parsed once.
//
// Three things read this file and they must not disagree about it: the Sparkle
// appcast, which renders one section as HTML at release time; the GitHub release
// body, which renders the same section as markdown; and the app's What's New
// pane, which is generated from the most recent sections at build time. Two
// parsers over one hand-written file drift the first time somebody writes a
// bullet in a shape neither anticipated, and the failure is silent in both
// directions — the appcast keeps rendering while the pane quietly drops a
// bullet. So there is one parser, `renderHTML` below is the appcast's renderer
// moved here verbatim, and which sections a user is never shown is decided here
// once (`HIDDEN_SECTIONS`) rather than by each caller.
//
// Both renderers read `entry.paragraphs` and nothing else. That is the whole
// reason entries carry their raw paragraphs alongside the `headline`/`body`
// split the Swift generator wants: the release paths never see the split, so
// changing how the split works cannot move a byte of the appcast.

/**
 * One bullet.
 *
 * `paragraphs` is what the source said, with continuation lines joined by a
 * single space — the shape the HTML renderer has always emitted. `headline` is
 * the leading `**…**` span with its asterisks removed, or null: not every
 * bullet in this file opens with one, so a required headline would be a lie
 * about the format.

 * notes every user reads before agreeing to replace an app that reads every agent
 * session on the Mac.
 *
 * @typedef {{ name: string, lead: string[], entries: Entry[] }} Group
 */

/**
 * What a release is, in one line and a sentence or two: the first paragraph
 * under its `## ` heading, when that paragraph opens with a `**…**` title.
 *
 * It is what the website's page for the version leads with, what its social
 * card shows, and what gets posted with the link, so it is written for somebody
 * who has never opened the app. Optional: releases before 1.9.0 have none, and a
 * lead paragraph without a bold title is prose, not a summary.
 *
 * `title` and `description` are the source's markdown; `plain` strips it for
 * the places markup cannot go: a post, an og:description, a PNG.
