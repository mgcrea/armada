// One CHANGELOG section, as HTML for the Sparkle appcast or as markdown for the
// GitHub release body.
//
// Sparkle renders an item's `<description>` as HTML in a WKWebView, and `make
// appcast` used to slice the raw markdown straight into the CDATA. Every user's
// update dialog therefore showed literal `###` headings, `- ` bullets and `**`
// around the lead of each entry — the release notes somebody reads before
// agreeing to replace an app that reads every agent session on the Mac, rendered
// as source.
//
// ## Why a renderer here rather than a dependency
//
// The release path must not gain one for this. `make appcast` runs in CI
// between notarization and the upload, on a checkout whose node_modules exist
// for the packages rather than for the Makefile, and a markdown library is a
// supply-chain edge on the one target that signs a release. What the CHANGELOG
// actually uses is small and stable: `###` headings, bullets with continuation
// paragraphs, bold, italic, code spans and links. Anything richer — nested
// bullets, fenced code, tables — renders as its own source rather than
// wrongly, which is the failure this replaces and is why the omission is
// tolerable.
//
// The parse and both renderers live in `lib/changelog.mjs`, shared with the
// generator behind the app's What's New pane so that the three cannot disagree
// about what a bullet is, or about which sections (`HIDDEN_SECTIONS`) a user is
// never shown. What stays here is what is true of this caller and not of
// markdown: which section to take, the guards below, and escaping `]]>`.
//
// ## Why `--markdown`
//
// The GitHub release body was the literal first section of the file, cut out
// with awk in the workflow: whatever section came first, `### Internal`
// included, and never checked against the tag. It now comes from here, so the
// release page and the update dialog are one section, chosen by version and
// guarded the same way.
//
// ## Why the version is an argument
//
// The Makefile matched `## [$version]` rather than taking the top section, and
// failed the build when nothing matched, on the reasoning that a heading typo —
// `## [1.1]` against `## [1.1.0]` — would otherwise ship an update dialog with
// nothing in it. That guard moved in here with the slicing it guards, so the
// two cannot drift apart: this exits non-zero rather than printing an empty
// description, and neither `make appcast` nor the release job has a fallback
// that would paper over it.
//
