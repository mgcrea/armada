/**
 * The og:image cards, composed from `design/armada-icon.svg` rather than drawn
 * beside it: the site's (`composeCard`) and one per release (`composeReleaseCard`).
 *
 * bastion and cupertino compose theirs with `composeCard` and `composeReleaseCard`
 * in their repo-root `scripts/lib/lockup.mjs`, which also writes the README banner.
 * Armada has no lockup yet (design/README.md: "If one is ever needed, this is where
 * it goes"), so these smaller composers live beside the scripts that use them. When
 * a lockup module lands at the root, move both there rather than growing a twin.
 * The release card was put here for that reason rather than in a module of its
 * own: two composers sharing one ground, one icon embed and one escape are one
 * move later, and two files would be two.
 *
 * It is a vertical stack, not the siblings' horizontal lockup, for a mechanical
 * reason: centring icon and word as one block needs the word's rendered width,
 * which the siblings get from a CoreText measurement typed into their module.
 * Stacked and centred with `text-anchor="middle"`, nothing here needs measuring.
 *
 * Nothing is redrawn. The sails, the water, the plate and the squircle all come
 * from the embedded icon; the only numbers here are layout.
 *
 * Baked, not served: `pnpm icons` renders this to PNG on the machine that runs it,
 * so the typeface resolves there. That is safe only because it runs on a Mac.
 * Rendered on Linux, the system stack would silently fall back to another font.

//
// One per version, for the link to /changelog/<version>/: the picture X, Slack and

// centred stack, so the two read as one family in a feed, but carrying the
// version, the release's own title and its date, so two releases shared in one
// feed do not look like the same post.
//
// Baked on a Mac and committed, for the reason og-image.png is: the font resolves
// on the machine that renders it, and Linux CI would swap it.
//
// Unlike `composeCard`, this one has to fit text it did not choose: a title from
// CHANGELOG.md. There are no font metrics at render time, and the reason this file
// stacks rather than measures holds here too, so it wraps on an ESTIMATE of each
// character's advance in SF Pro Display semibold, generous rather than exact, and
// refuses a title that needs a third line rather than letting it run into the
// footer. `SUMMARY_TITLE_MAX` in scripts/lib/changelog.mjs is the matching bound
// on the source side, and a test there asks this wrap, so a title is turned down
// in `pnpm test:scripts` long before it reaches here. Centred lines need no
