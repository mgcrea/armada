/**
 * One social card per release, for the link to /changelog/<version>/.
 *
 *   pnpm cards           # render every card that is missing or stale
 *   pnpm cards --check   # fail if one is, without rendering anything
 *
 * A release gets a card when its CHANGELOG section opens with a summary, a
 * `**Title.** description` paragraph: see `Summary` in scripts/lib/changelog.mjs.
 * Releases before 1.9.0 have none, and their pages fall back to the site card.
 *
 * ## Baked on a Mac, checked anywhere
 *
 * The PNG is rendered here and committed, for the reason og-image.png is (see
 * generate-icons.mjs): the title is set in whatever font the rendering machine
 * resolves, and a Linux machine would quietly swap SF Pro for something else. So
 * a check cannot render a card to compare it.
 *
 * What it can do is compose the SVG, which is text and needs no font, and hash
 * it. `src/data/release-cards.json` records the hash of the SVG each PNG was
 * rendered from, so `--check` catches a card that has fallen behind its title,
 * its date, the icon, the palette or the layout in social-card.mjs, on a machine
 * that could never render it. `make changelog` runs this at release time, which
 * is when a new summary appears, and `make changelog-check` runs `--check`.
 *
 * The manifest is also what tells the site a card exists: src/data/changelog.ts
 * points a release's og:image at its PNG only when the manifest names it, so a
 * page never links a picture that was never rendered.
 *
 * The PNGs are LFS objects (apps/website/.gitattributes). A checkout without LFS
 * has 130-byte pointers where they should be; `--check` only asks that the file
 * exists, so it passes there too, which is right: the hash is the claim, and the
 * job that ships the site checks out with LFS.
