 *
 * No CORS, on purpose. It answers no OPTIONS request and sets no
 * Access-Control-Allow-* header, and it refuses any body not labelled
 * `application/json`, which a browser will not send to another origin without
 * a preflight. That preflight lands on the 404 below, so a page elsewhere can
 * neither read this route's answer nor make a visitor's browser call it. A
 * plain form post, which skips the preflight, cannot carry that type and gets
 * 415.
 *
 * Answers identically whether or not the address is a customer, in body AND in
 * time. Anything else makes this an oracle for "did this person buy Armada",
 * which is a question a stranger should not be able to ask a thousand times a
 * second. The answer is settled before anything is looked up, and the lookup
 * and send run in `waitUntil` after it has gone, so a customer's address
 * costing a D1 read and an email does not make for a slower response.
