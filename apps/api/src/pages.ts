// The page someone lands on straight after paying.
//
// Rendered here rather than on the marketing site because the key has to come
// from the database, and the site is static assets under a strict CSP that would
// block it fetching anything. One self-contained page, no external requests, so
// it needs no CSP relaxation of its own and cannot break when the site redeploys.
//
// The palette is the site's, by hand. It cannot import design/colors.json: this
// is a Worker bundle, and a build step to inline three hex values would cost more
// than it saves. The one thing to keep true is the accent, which is the site's
// --color-accent, #f6a177, in apps/website/src/styles/tokens.css.
